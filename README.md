🎶 Custom Disk is a Minecraft mod still in the works, letting you drop your own banger tracks straight into the game through fully customizable music discs.

Wanna blast some S3RL, Dr. Dre, Vengeur Masqué, or your own homemade beats while stacking blocks like a legend? That’s exactly what Custom Disk is made for.

⚙️ Main Features:

    💿 Add custom music discs with unique textures and assigned audio.

    🔊 Plays natively through the vanilla Minecraft jukebox.

    🖼️ Custom textures for every disc (yes, you can slap your own face on it, go nuts).

    📁 Super simple config system to add/edit tracks.

    🔄 Frequent updates planned: more customization, better compatibility, and extra features (crafting, loot, visual FX, you name it).

🧪 Current Mod Status:

⚠️ Still in development. Some stuff is missing or experimental. We're working on it like caffeinated monkeys to give you a clean, smooth, badass experience.

Planned updates include:

    Full survival integration (craftable discs, chest loot, etc.)

    Support for both Fabric and Forge

    GUI to make adding tracks even easier for lazy legends

📦 Installation:

Currently supports Minecraft 1.20.1 (Forge)
Other versions coming soon based on hype and feedback.
